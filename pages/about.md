Hi, I'm Santi.

I was born in [Buenos Aires](https://www.argentina.travel/en/buenos-aires/caba){:target="_blank"}, Argentina, studied economics at [BYU](https://www.byu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and am studying software development at Dev Mountain.

In 2018 I learned about [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and became obsessed with learning about the fiat monetary system. Then came trustless primitives, trading systems, and figuring out how markets actually tick. That rabbit hole eventually led me to experience at [Album](https://www.album.vc/){:target="_blank"}, [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/){:target="_blank"} and a trading role at [Amelyore](https://www.amelyore.io){:target="_blank"}, a digital assets hedge fund.

These days, I'm fascinated by stablecoin rails and all things AI (mostly agentic workflows, RL/fine-tuning, and exploring the limits of autonomous trading agents).

I spend my free time hanging out with my wife and two boys, traveling, and working on my 1978 F-150.

Hi, I'm Santi.

I was born in [Buenos Aires](https://www.argentina.travel/en/buenos-aires/caba){:target="_blank"}, Argentina, studied economics at [BYU](https://www.byu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and love to learn new things. In 2018 I discovered [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and became obsessed with learning about the fiat monetary system. Then came trustless primitives, trading systems, and figuring out how markets actually tick. That rabbit hole eventually led me to [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/){:target="_blank"} and a trading role at [Amelyore](https://www.amelyore.io){:target="_blank"}, a digital assets hedge fund.

These days, I'm fascinated by stablecoin rails and all things AI (mostly agentic workflows, RL/fine-tuning, and pushing open-source models on whatever hardware I can get my hands on).

I spend my free time reading, improving my coding skills, tinkering with image/video gen models, and pushing the limits of autonomous trading agents.
